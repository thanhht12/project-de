One of the great things about Python is that it has some very cool mini-projects, and one of them is definitely 'translator'. I always use mini-projects to practice programming, for two reasons: first, to be able to work with the programming language I learned, and second, to find and enjoy libraries.
I coded this fascinating mini-project and said it might be interesting to write about it.
You need to use the translate library to create this attractive project (of course, if you use another language, you can look for libraries related to that language). In this mini-project, the idea is that:
